ISUZU Malaysia Sdn Bhd today handed over a whopping 277 units of various models of its light duty lorry, medium duty lorry and prime mover to its key customer, courier company City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd, a deal that was facilitated and completed through the former’s dealer Jumbo Arena Sdn Bhd.

Part of the light duty trucks are equipped with the Isuzu “Safety Plus” platform, which extends four important safety features including anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brake force distribution (EBD), anti-slip regulator (ASR) and airbag.
With the delivery, City-Link Express becomes the first Malaysian customer to own the Isuzu Safety Plus in its fleet after the Sept 1 launch of the safety platform by Isuzu Malaysia.

Isuzu Malaysia CEO Koji Nakamura said: “We are extremely delighted to deliver the new Isuzu trucks to City-Link Express, one of our long-term valued customers in Malaysia. This delivery signifies Isuzu’s commitment in supporting City-Link Express on achieving its business objectives despite the current environment.
“Our trucks are built with the Isuzu S.E.E Technology at its core, which represents safety, economy and environment to offer all our customers like City-Link Express the reliability, efficiency and versatility that they demand to help increase their business sustainability and output.

City-Link express has been using Isuzu lorries for the past 10 years and the decision to procure the additional Isuzu lorries came out of the company’s satisfaction with the vehicles and Isuzu offering City-Link Express with the most cost-effective solutions, as the lorries being fuel-efficient plus the cost of their parts, services and maintenance are competitive, which helps the company reduce on its operational costs.

In addition, the “black box” or Data Recording Module feature in Isuzu lorries are also important for City-Link as it allows the company to be more efficient with tracking and recording engine performance and driver behaviour, among other things.
